# Interfacing three different sensors with Raspberry Pi through different protocols, presenting the sensor data, and integrating an AI model on a dashboard.
## Walkthrough of steps to install and run the project
The project used Raspberry Pi as a central control unit coupled with three different sensors that communicate different communication protocols and display all sensor data on a dashboard. To also integrate an AI model on the dashboard.
